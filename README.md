# First-lines
Just doing as the tutorial says

Hey there, I am just getting started with GitHub, I am looking foward to become a freelance web developer by learning multiple
programming languages such as Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript and their tools. I hope it would help me with my carreer and to be able
to put my creativity to a good use. I guess I'll be posting everything here, so I hope you enjoy everything I make, since you will
be my first critics. Peace!
